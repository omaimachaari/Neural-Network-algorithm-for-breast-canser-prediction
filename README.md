#ANN project for breast cancer prediction#

In this project I have worked on making an ANN machine learning algorithm that predicts breast canser patients with 96% accuracy level. 
I chose for the first layer 10 nodes, with RELU activation function, the hidden layer had 8 nodes with RELU and the final layer 2 nodes that showcase a binary result either the patient has or do not have cancer.
