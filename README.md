# ANN project for breast cancer prediction #

In this project, I worked on making an ANN machine learning algorithm that predicted breast cancer patients with a 87% accuracy level. 
I chose for the first layer 10 nodes, with RELU activation function, the hidden layer had 8 nodes with RELU, and the final layer had 2 nodes that showcase a binary result either the patient has or does not have cancer.
